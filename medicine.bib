The results are examined in the light of general observations and compared with those obtained from the principles of minimum work and minimum volume. It is shown that in some aspects the new principle is equally consistent with observations, and, in other aspects, it is perhaps more plausible than the other two principles.},

        abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid {\ensuremath{\beta}} (A{\ensuremath{\beta}}) in the extracellular spaces of the cerebral cortex and in blood vessel walls as cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the ageing human brain. Studies in animals suggest that A{\ensuremath{\beta}} is eliminated from the brain either directly into the blood or along perivascular interstitial fluid drainage channels. The aim of the present study is to define the perivascular route for the drainage of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} from the human brain. Smears and paraffin sections of post-mortem cortical tissue from 17 cases of AD and from two controls were stained with thioflavin and for A{\ensuremath{\beta}} by immunohistochemistry. Histology and confocal microscopy showed that deposits of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} in the cortical parenchyma were continuous with A{\ensuremath{\beta}} in capillary walls but A{\ensuremath{\beta}} in artery walls was not in continuity with A{\ensuremath{\beta}} in brain parenchyma. Quantitative studies supported these observations. The results of this study suggest that when A{\ensuremath{\beta}} is eliminated from the extracellular spaces of the human brain by the perivascular route, it enters pericapillary spaces and from there drains along the walls of cortical arteries to leptomeningeal arteries. Factors such as overproduction of A{\ensuremath{\beta}}, entrapment of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} in drainage pathways and poor drainage of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} due to functional changes in ageing arteries might result in the failure of elimination of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} from the ageing brain and play a major role in the pathogenesis of AD. Such factors might affect therapies for AD that entail administration of anti-A{\ensuremath{\beta}} antibodies to eliminate A{\ensuremath{\beta}} from the human brain.}

        abstract = {Experimental studies and observations in the human brain indicate that interstitial fluid and solutes, such as amyloid-{\ensuremath{\beta}} (A{\ensuremath{\beta}}), are eliminated from grey matter of the brain along pericapillary and periarterial pathways. It is unclear, however, what constitutes the motive force for such transport within blood vessel walls, which is in the opposite direction to blood flow. In this paper the potential for global pressure differences to achieve such transport are considered. A mathematical model is constructed in order to test the hypothesis that perivascular drainage of interstitial fluid and solutes out of brain tissue is driven by pulsations of the blood vessel walls. Here it is assumed that drainage occurs through a thin layer between astrocytes and endothelial cells or between smooth muscle cells. The model suggests that, during each pulse cycle, there are periods when fluid and solutes are driven along perivascular spaces in the reverse direction to the flow of blood. It is shown that successful drainage may depend upon some attachment of solutes to the lining of the perivascular space, in order to produce a valve-like effect, although an alternative without this requirement is also postulated. Reduction in pulse amplitude, as in ageing cerebral vessels, would prolong the attachment time, encourage precipitation of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} peptides in vessel walls, and impair elimination of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} from the brain. These factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and in the accumulation of A{\ensuremath{\beta}} in the brain in Alzheimer's disease.}
